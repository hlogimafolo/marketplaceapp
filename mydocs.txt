I have no required fields
Personal details page only selects the 1st service provider, so if you have two service providers with the same merchant_id, then it'll only take the 1st service provider.

DONT WORRY ABOUT THESE:
My edit buttons dont work
My 'Buy Credits' button doesnt work

My App starts at admin.php, which is the "Create a profile page"
Then it proceeds to profile_create.php : Personal Details
Then it proceeds to profile_create_services.php : Service Offering Details
Then it proceeds to profile_create_areas.php : Areas of Operation
	When you click on a location, its checkbox options will appear

Then it proceeds to profile_create_portfolio.php : Images of work done

In the Dashboard:
I have Customer requests, which should come from you.(each with a lead_id, which is a Job request Id 
When you click "VIEW DETAILS", you see the lead or request details, from where you can send a quote.
Then you can send a quote, with the description and amount,
Then you can confirm the quote details before you send it

Once the quote is sent, it redirects to purchased_leads.php(MY QUOTES)
The idea is that, once the quote is accepted, it would mmove into the (MY PROJECTS PAGE)
